        I am an experienced polyglot software engineer with a particular interest in the developer tooling space. I've worked at a wide range of startups, ranging from tiny teams of two or three people to massive corporations of thousands of people.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment I am working with the lovely people at <a href="keel.xyz" target="_blank">keel.xyz</a> - we're building a declarative schema language and accompanying runtime from scratch, which will remove a significant amount of complexity in development of backend services, and allow teams to focus on creating delightful experiences for their users.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love to work in languages that prioritize great developer experience - some of my favourites are Ruby and Golang. At the moment, I'm mostly working in Golang and TypeScript in a professional capacity. At home, well, I have a newborn, so there is no coding in my personal time anymore!!
