I've had a website for as long as I can remember - in that time, I've lost count how many times I've redesigned it, moved to a different cloud provider, picked shiny new framework X or Y.

The authoring workflow was never quite right. As a professional developer, I spend most of my life on Github and by extension, I write a _lot_ of markdown.

So, I gave in and embraced the Markdown, specifically Markdown's cooler older brother [MDX](http://mdxjs.com).

Hopefully I can finally memorise which way round the `[` + `]` and `(` + `)` go to create a hyperlink!

** title inspired by the recent death of Queen Elizabeth - I don't consider myself a Royalist but it felt timely.
